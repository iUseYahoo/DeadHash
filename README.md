# DeadHash

# Information
- DeadHash is a super basic text hasher using the hashlib within python. This uses no salting. (Don't use for databases please)

# Software Needed
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Installation
- Run command: `python setup.py` and wait for it to be done.

# How to use
- Run command: `python deadhash.py` and use it like it tells you to.

# WARNING
- Please do not use this script for storing emails, passwords or anything needing to be hashed into a database.

# Why did I make this?
- I made this so I can send bullshit messages to my less techy friends and say something mean about them. (Yeah I'm not a good friend right?)
